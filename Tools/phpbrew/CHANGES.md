CHANGES
=======

### Version 1.24.0

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew/releases) on GitHub.

### Version 1.23.1
- Use default cURL timeouts in Downloader to avoid accidental installation failures (c9s/CurlKit#3).
- Fixed a PHP notice in --debug mode (#919).
- Improved handling of invalid arguments in `phpbrew use` (#822).
- Removed the warning about rootless mode in macOS (#879).
- Fixed handling failure to create a temporary file (#937).
- Fixed handling `$PATH`s containing whitespaces (#823).

### Version 1.23.0
- Changed the semantics of the `each` command (#888). Prior to this release, the arguments were interpreted as internal PHPBrew command (e.g. `phpbrew each install xdebug` would install the Xdebug extensions on all available builds). As of this release, the command is interpreted as a shell command, i.e. the previously mentioned command will now look like `phpbrew each phpbrew ext install xdebug`. This change opens the possibility to run shell commands like `phpbrew each phpunit` and internal PHPBrew commands implemented in shell like `phpbrew each phpbrew fpm restart`.
- Added support for php pre-release versions, including alpha, beta and RC (#915) 
- Improved the "ext enable" command (#911)

        phpbrew fpm setup --launchctl

    Users might prefer readline over libedit

    because only readline supports readline_list_history()
    (http://www.php.net/readline-list-history).  On the other hand we want
    libedit to be the default because its license is compatible with PHP's
    which means PHP can be distributable.
